# Dayta

Built this iOS app with the central idea of introspection through data analysis. The idea was to make a very dynamic app, where people could track whatever they want about themselves, that was not an imposition to do every day (top level survey questions could be completed in 30 seconds or less).

The only mandatory question is rating your day from 1-7. This value I use as the label for supervised learning, and correlations between each aspect tracked and how well the users day went. Each survey question can be tracked through visualizations in an analytics page.
